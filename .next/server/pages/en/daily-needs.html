Red flowers with 5 petals appear in the spring before the new foliage. It produces a capsule which, when ripe, contains white fibres like cotton. Its trunk bears spikes to deter attacks by animals. Although its stout trunk suggests that it is useful for timber, its wood is too soft to be very useful.","type_id":7,"price":3.29,"shop_id":6,"sale_price":2.49,"min_price":3.29,"max_price":3.29,"sku":"568513688351","quantity":50,"in_stock":1,"is_taxable":0,"shipping_class_id":null,"status":"publish","product_type":"simple","unit":"1lbs","height":null,"width":null,"length":null,"image":{"id":993,"original":"https://pickbazarlaravel.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/993/Root5.jpg","thumbnail":"https://pickbazarlaravel.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/993/conversions/Root5-thumbnail.jpg"},"video":null,"gallery":[],"deleted_at":null,"created_at":"2021-09-29T10:24:24.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-12-23T16:57:39.000000Z","author_id":null,"manufacturer_id":null,"is_digital":0,"is_external":0,"external_product_url":null,"external_product_button_text":null,"ratings":0,"total_reviews":0,"rating_count":[],"my_review":null,"in_wishlist":false,"type":{"id":7,"name":"Daily Needs","settings":{"isHome":false,"layoutType":"minimal","productCard":"neon"},"slug":"daily-needs","icon":"FruitsVegetable","promotional_sliders":null,"created_at":"2021-09-27T14:08:07.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-09-27T14:08:07.000000Z"},"author":null},{"id":548,"name":"Floriculture Greens Purple Turnip Shalgam 1lbs","slug":"floriculture-greens-purple-turnip-shalgam-1lbs","description":"Sold By Floriculture Greens Provide 100% Best Quality Hybrid Seeds Of Vegetable Plants.
